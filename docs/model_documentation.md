## 1. Overview

The energy demand model of the ITRC-MISTRAL framework allows 
the simulation of long-term changes in energy demand patterns
for the residential, service and industry sector on a high temporal
and spatial scale. National end-use specific energy demand data is
disaggregated on local authority district level and a bottom-up approach
is implemented for hourly energy demand estimation for different fuel types
and end-uses.
Future energy demand is simulated based on different
socio-technical scenario assumptions such as technology efficiencies,
changes in the technological mix per end-use consumptions or behavioural change.
Energy demand is simulated in relation to changes in scenario drivers of the
base year. End-use specific socio-technical drivers for energy demands
are defined and modelled where possible on a household level.

The energy demand model integrates energy demands across
all ITRC models and provides demands to the supply model.

## 2 Energy demand simulation

Total energy demand of a (simulation) year (![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?ED_%7By%7D%5E%7Btot%7D "ED_{y}^{tot}")) is calculated over all regions (r), sectors (s), end-uses (e), technologies (t) and fuel-types (f) as follows:


![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?ED_%7By%7D%5E%7Btot%7D%20%3D%20%5Csum_%7Br%7D%20%5Csum_%7Bs%7D%5Csum_%7Be%7D%5Csum_%7Bt%7D%5Csum_%7Bf%7DED_%7BSD%7D%20&plus;%20ED_%7Beff%7D%20&plus;%20ED_%7Btech%7D%20&plus;%20ED_%7Bclimate%7D%20&plus;%20ED_%7Bbehaviour%7D "ED_{y}^{tot} = \sum_{r} \sum_{s}\sum_{e}\sum_{t}\sum_{f}ED_{SD} + ED_{eff} + ED_{tech} + ED_{climate} + ED_{behaviour}")

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?ED_%7BSD%7D "ED_{SD}: "):        Demand change related to change in scenario driver (SD)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?ED_%7Beff%7D "ED_{eff}"):      Demand change related to change in technology efficiency

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?ED_%7Btech%7D "ED_{tech}"):      Demand change related to change in technology mix

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?ED_%7Bclimate%7D "ED_{climate}"):  Demand change related to change in climate

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?ED_%7Bbehaviour%7D "ED_{behaviour}"):      Demand change related to change in behaviour (e.g. smart meter, base temperatures)

Energy demand change in relation to the base year (by) for end-use specific scenario drivers is defined as follows: 

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?ED_%7BSD%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7BED_%7BSD%7D%5E%7Btot%7D%7D%7BSD%28by%29%7D%20*%20SD%28simulation%20year%29 "ED_{SD} = \frac{ED_{SD}^{tot}}{SD(by)} * SD(simulation year)")

For the residential and service sub-model, SD values are calculated based on a dwelling stock where scenario drivers are calculated either for dwellings or a group of dwelling (e.g. dwelling types).

## 12 Used Data Sets

This section provides an overview of all used datasets in HIRE and necessary data preparation.

### 12.1 National Energy Data

The base year energy consumption of the UK (ECUK) in terms of fuels and technology shares for the residential, service and industry sectors is taken from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy ([BEIS, 2016](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/energy-consumption-in-the-uk)). National final energy data is provided for 6 fuel types (solid fuel, gas, electricity, oil, heat sold, bioenergy and waste) in the unit of ktoe (tonne of oil equivalents). All energy unit conversions are based on the unit converter by the International Energy Agency ([IEA, 2017](http://www.iea.org/statistics/resources/unitconverter)).


### 12.2 Household Electricity Servey

The [Household Electricity Survey (HES)](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/household-electricity-survey) is the most detailed monitoring of electricity use ever carried out in the UK.
Electricity consumption was monitored at an appliance level in 250 owner-occupied households across England from 2010 to 2011. The load profiles for different residential enduses are taken from a [24 hour spreadsheet tool](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/spreadsheet-tools-for-users).

> **Data preparation**
>
> Monthly load profiles were taken from a 24 hours preadsheet tool and aggregated on an hourly basis.

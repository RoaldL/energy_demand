    """Enduse Class (Residential, Service and Industry)

    For every region and sector, a different instance
    is generated. In this class, first the change in
    energy demand is calculated on a yearls temporal scale.
    Calculations are performed in a cascade (e.g. first
    reducing climate change induced savings, then substracting
    further behavioural savings etc.). After yearly calculations,
    the demand is converted to hourly demand.

    Also within this function, the fuel inputs are converted
    to energy service (short: service) and later on
    converted back to fuel demand.

    ----
    - Load profiles are assigned independently of the fueltype, i.e.
      the same profiles are assumed to hold true across different fueltypes

    - ``self.fuel_new_y`` is always overwritten in the cascade of calculations

    Warning
    -------
    Not all enduses have technologies assigned. Load peaks are derived
    from techstock in case technologies are defined. Otherwise enduse load
    profiles are used.
